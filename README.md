Creation of a basic web calculator ...

## What is this project about :grey_question:

This is a web development exercise carried out with the BECODE training to learn various aspects and coding techniques. Here there will be very little HTML, CSS according to everyone's preferences and mainly JavaScript.Entrez ici les 

### Pre-requisite :bowtie:

what you need to get started ...

- basics in HTML
- basics in CSS
- basics in JavaScript
- Top work mates or a good ability to do internet research on your own :muscle: 

## What did I use?

- Generating JavaScript code from HTML code
- Create elements
- Targeting elements in HTML
- Function
- Event
- the conditions
- the loops
etc.

## strengths

- I learned intensively through this exercise and these difficulties.
- The result is rather nice, when you have never done this before in your life and the coding is all new to you.

## weaknesses

- I didn't have a basic knowledge of JavaSript ...:disappointed:
So it was hard for me to know which way to go, sometimes it seemed like Chinese.

## Advices

It is important to understand the subtleties of language JavaScript so I advise you to do some algorithmic exercises to get used to logic. 

Learn about the structure, the synthase of language and learning is in practice so start again and do not lose hope.
